Real AI Agent Integration
Replace the hardcoded state-machine chatbot with a real LLM-powered agent using OpenAI GPT-4o with tool/function calling. The AI agent lives on the backend and uses tools to validate data, present agreements, and create accounts.

Requires an OpenAI API key set as OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or in a .env file.

Proposed Changes
Backend
[NEW] 
agent.py
The core AI agent module:

System prompt — instructs GPT-4o to act as Apex Financial's account opening assistant, collecting required fields one by one, validating, reviewing, getting agreement consent, and creating the account
Tools (function calling):
validate_field(field_name, value) — validates a single field using existing Pydantic logic
show_agreement() — returns the Terms & Conditions text for the user to review
create_account(data)
 — creates the account via the existing endpoint logic, returns account/routing numbers
Session management — in-memory dict of session_id → conversation_history to maintain context across messages
Agentic loop — processes tool calls iteratively until the model produces a final text response
[MODIFY] 
main.py
Add POST /api/chat endpoint accepting {message, sessionId} — calls the agent and returns {reply, metadata}
Keep existing POST /api/accounts for direct API access
Add python-dotenv + openai to imports
[MODIFY] 
requirements.txt
Add openai and python-dotenv dependencies.

Frontend
[MODIFY] 
ChatFlow.jsx
Replace the entire state-machine logic with a simple chat relay:

Send user messages to POST /api/chat with a sessionId
Display bot responses (text with markdown formatting)
Keep the typing indicator, message bubbles, and input area
Render structured data (account details) when metadata contains them
Agreement is now handled conversationally by the AI agent (the agent asks "Do you agree?" and the user types their response)
Remove dependencies on 
validators.js
 and 
Agreement.jsx
 from the frontend (validation and agreement now live on the backend agent).

Verification Plan
Automated
Start backend with OPENAI_API_KEY=... python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
Start frontend with npm run dev
Test via browser: open chatbot, walk through the full flow conversationally, verify the AI asks for each field, validates, shows T&C, and returns account numbers
